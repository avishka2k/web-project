        <p> Protein is important for building and repairing muscles and for our immune system. 
            For this reason, we all need it in our diets, not just aspiring body builders! safe 
            food research fellow, Sally Griffin, tells us more about the different sources of protein.
        </P>

    <h2>What should we be eating to get an adequate amount of protein?</h2>

        <p>Protein belongs to the meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and nuts group. 
            Two servings per day from this group are recommended. Beans, peas and lentils are 
            good sources of plant protein and are low in fat. Meat is a rich source of protein, 
            so if you decide to exclude or reduce your meat intake you will need to get your 
            protein from other foods. Eating a variety of different food sources that are 
            high in protein, from lentils to eggs will ensure that you get what you need.
        </p>
        <p>Plant sources of protein can be very convenient and versatile. They have shorter cooking times, 
            they can be cheaper to buy (especially canned peas, beans, lentils) but still delicious! 
            Personally, I have made an effort to try new meat free meals this year. For example, 
            the curried chickpea and sweet potato burger is a go-to of mine because I can have it 
            for lunch (in a wrap with hummus, or a salad) or for dinner in a bun with some homemade chips. 
            If that doesn’t tickle your fancy, have a look at our meat-free recipes.

    <h2>Vegetarian meat substitutes</h2>

        <p>There is a large range of vegetarian meat substitute products on the market right now, 
            and some of us may see them as a healthier option. Plant based burgers, sausages, 
            mince, chicken alternatives, steaks, fish alternatives, kievs, pastries, pies and 
            more are available to buy. We did some research and found these products are in 
            fact processed and have long ingredient lists. Protein content varied, with 1 in 4 
            products lacking adequate protein. Meat substitutes are low in energy, sugar, and 
            saturated fat, and some are a source of fiber (unlike meat). You can still enjoy 
            meat alternative products but remember they are processed foods so they should not 
            be used as sole replacements for protein rich foods, and intake should be limited.
            Our advice is to read food labels and look for products that are a source of protein and 
            lower in saturated fat, sugar, and salt. There are lots of other dietary sources of 
            protein that you can choose from including meat, poultry, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, 
            tofu, and chickpeas.
